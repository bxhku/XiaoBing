**I. Whole-Sub-6 GHz Loop Antenna by Multi-Order Dual-Degenerated Modes Feeding mechanism** (For UAV/Smartwatch/smart glasses) <br /><br />
This antenna is proposed that can excite multi-order dual-degenerated loop modes, which almost doubles the excited modes of a common loop. Thus, it can easily *cover the whole Sub-6 GHz band as a small antenna*. 12 modes are excited simultaneously.

**II. Unmodified present display screen module designed as antennas of mobile smart devices** (For Smartwatch/Smartphone)  <br /><br />
The unmodified present commercial smartwatch screen is designed as part of the antenna. The fundamental structure of the smartwatch (including the full screen and the system PCB) is analyzed as a whole and modified as the radiator for a multi-band antenna. This method helps to improve the performance of smartwatch antennas. This method could design very small-size smartwatch antennas, add more frequency bands easily, radiate omni-directionally, and fit to the structures of present smartwatches.

**III.  Dual-port penta-band linear antenna for multi-purpose smart glasses** (For Smart Glasses)<br />
<br />
This antenna utilizes the smart glasses’ metal frame as a radiator. Embedded and capacitive coupler element (CCE) ports are assigned in the middle. Thus, all the first several characteristic modes of this linear dipole antenna could be excited simultaneously. The antenna covers four ISM bands, including 433 MHz, 915 MHz, 2450 MHz, and 5800 MHz for IoT applications and GPS L1 band (1575 MHz) for outdoor navigation.

**IV.  Dipole Antenna with Both Odd and Even Modes Excited and Tuned** (For Smart Glasses, Smartwatch Strap)
<br /><br />
Dipole antenna is the simplest type of antenna from the theoretical point of view. It has alternating odd and even modes. In classical antenna theory, only odd modes are excited. The even modes are difficult to be excited due to their very high input impedances. In this paper, both odd and even modes of the dipole antenna are excited simultaneously by a single port with a novel feeding structure. Thus, all the first six modes of a common dipole are excited, among which five modes are utilized for IoT applications. The antenna can cover ISM bands of 868 MHz and 2450 MHz, GNSS band of 1575 MHz, and 5G bands of 3500 MHz and 4900 MHz. This research could broaden the application of this classic antenna.

**V.  Algorithm for fewest arms of any multi-band linear dipole antenna** (For Smart Glasses, Smartwatch Strap)
<br /><br />
An algorithm based on sharing arms to calculate the fewest arms required by any linear multi-band dipole antenna is proposed. The exemplified penta-band dipole antenna can cover 5 narrow discrete bands with only 2.5 pairs of arms. 50% of arms are reduced compared to traditional methods. Antennas designed by this algorithm can achieve multi-band radiation while conforming to ultra-narrow surfaces, such as smart glasses and smartwatch straps.

**VI.  Enhanced Multi-band Quasi-isotropic Antenna for Massive IoT of 6G** (For Smart Glasses/UAV/Smartwatch Strap)<br />
<br />
Quasi-isotropic antennas are essential for mobile smart devices in massive IoT of 6G, such as smart glasses and UAVs. However, at most two discrete frequency bands can be realized until now. It is because of the substantially increased structural complexity with the increased number of frequency bands. Since dual-band is much far from the massive IoT requirement, we investigate the enhanced multi-band ( > 2) quasi-isotropic antennas. Quad-band and hexa-band quasi-isotropic antennas are proposed for the first time. [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05383)
